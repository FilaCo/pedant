## What is Pedant?
Pedant is a framework for developing desktop applications and games in the Rust programming language.

## ðŸš¨ Not implemented! ðŸš¨
Pedant is still in the **VERY** early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse.
Please **DO NOT** use it to develop your projects until MVP is released.

Stay tuned!

## Design goals
1. **Capable, but coherent**: Offer a complete feature set to develop a 2D/3D game or a general purpose desktop 
app but nothing more
2. **Convenient, but clarified**: There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it
3. **Monolithic, but customizable**: Pedant provide all-in-one monolithic solution, but allow to extend its functionality with plugins.
